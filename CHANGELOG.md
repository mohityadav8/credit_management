## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-12
+ Added response hint in get_payment fontend api

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Razorpay Payment Provider** — Full integration with Razorpay payment links for credit top-up
- **`PaymentProvider` abstract base class** — Extensible provider architecture (Stripe-ready)
- **`PaymentService`** — Centralized payment processing with atomic credit updates
- **`update_payment_record_atomic()`** — MongoDB conditional update prevents double-crediting on concurrent webhooks
- **Reference ID tracking** — Uses host provider reference_id as unique identifier across all webhook events
- **Webhook signature verification** — HMAC-SHA256 verification for Razorpay (Stripe-ready)
- **Payment history endpoints** — View payment records and status via `/credits/payments/*`
- **Promo code system** — Promos with usage limits, expiry dates, and claim tracking
- **`_CREDIT_EVENTS` whitelist** — Only whitelisted events can add credits, preventing duplicate processing

### Changed
- Renamed `add_credits_atomic` to `update_payment_record_atomic` for clarity
- Added provider IDs (`provider_payment_id`, `provider_order_id`) to `PaymentRecord` model
- Webhook processing now skips events with no matching record (prevents duplicates)
- State machine enforcement via `_is_forward()` ensures payment status only moves forward

### Fixed
- Race condition where multiple webhook events for the same payment could add credits multiple times
- Payment lookup now tries reference_id first for consistent matching across different event types
